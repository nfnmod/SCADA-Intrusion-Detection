# TODO: KLSTM- file names for injected test labels and files.
# TODO: FSTM- validation, testing, detection.

# Test parameters:
injection % : 40, 60, 80.
# bins: 3, 4, 5, 6.
features: v1_1, v2, v3_2.
binning: start with k-means only.

# DONT FORGET: CHANGE N_WINDOWS, DEBUG BINNING (?)

# KLSTM Training:
1. create events files for train, validation and test sets - IMPLEMENTED.
2. run KL on train, validation and test sets - IMPLEMENTED.
3. filter the TIRPs - IMPLEMENTED.
4. train LSTM on TIRPs in the train sets - IMPLEMENTED.
5. train OCSVM on the differences - IMPLEMENTED.
6. add default value of HS to the run of KL on all 3 sets- IMPLEMENTED.

# KLSTM-OCSVM Testing:
1. evaluate KLSTM predictions on benign data.
2. create test sets for KLSTM from the TIRPs found in the anomalous data.
3. test the full pipeline. get TIRP df of an injection -> predict -> get delta -> ocsvm -> count in the window.
