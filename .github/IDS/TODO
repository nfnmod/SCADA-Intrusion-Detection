# TODO: filter TIRPs by percentiles instead of HS value.
# TODO: find out about One Class RF, use it instead of OCSVM.
# TODO: unsupervised KL- tests, create test sets when testing.
# TODO: add KL based classifiers which learn on the difference from the prediction.
# TODO: modify test functions, export different columns and add TP, TF, FP, FN metrics.
